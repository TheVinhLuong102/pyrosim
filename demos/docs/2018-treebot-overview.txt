Questions:
Given a system which can evolve its morphology and control, what are the pressures necessary in order for evolution to find modular solutions?
Further, how do the solutions found reflect the structure of the environment they are placed in? 

Hypothesis:
Robots which can change their morphology are more capable of becoming modular than ones that cannot -- possibly obvious / known.
Specific pressure is necessary to generate modular solutions. Either modularly varying goals or cost functions.


Treebot Setup:
==============

Depth 3 treebot. 7 total branches. 4 leaves.
1 motor placed in each branch = 7 motors.
1 sensor placed in each leaf = 4 sensors.
~3 hidden neurons in each branch = 3*7=21 hidden neurons.
32 total neurons.

Robot is planar in the XY-plane meaning its motors can move branches left and right.

Environment consists of two types of cylinders. One the robot should point at, one the robot should not point at. This is a version of classification which requires the robot to understand where the objects are in the environment and how its own body movement impacts how it is viewing its environment.


Treatments:
===========

    Evolutionary Control:
    ---------------------
    Evolution can control weights only.
    Evolution can control weights and existence of weights.
    (evolution can control weights and joint range)
    Evolution can control weight, existence, and joint range

    Cost:
    -----
    No cost
    Connection Cost (existence only)
    Joint Cost (joint range only)

    Training Regiment:
    ------------------
    Edges of environment space (n*f specific environments)
    Random subset of env. space (n*f random environments)
